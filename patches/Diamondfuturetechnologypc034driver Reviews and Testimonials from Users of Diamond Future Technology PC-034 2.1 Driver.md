# Diamond Future Technology PC034 Driver: How to Install and Use It
 
If you have a device that uses the Diamond Future Technology PC034 chip, you may need to install a driver to make it work properly on your Windows 7 computer. The driver is a software that allows your device to communicate with your computer and perform its functions. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the driver, and how to use it with your device.
 
## What is the Diamond Future Technology PC034 chip?
 
The Diamond Future Technology PC034 chip is a USB to serial converter that enables you to connect serial devices such as modems, printers, scanners, or cameras to your computer via a USB port. The chip is based on the FTDI FT232R chip, which is a popular and reliable USB to serial converter from Future Technology Devices International Ltd (FTDI)[^4^]. The chip supports various data transfer rates, from 300 baud to 3 Mbaud, and has various features such as adjustable receive and transmit buffer timeout, support for non-standard baud rates, and configurable CBUS I/O pins.

## Where can I download the driver?
 
The driver for the Diamond Future Technology PC034 chip is available on the FTDI website[^4^]. You can choose between two types of driver: a virtual COM port (VCP) driver or a direct (D2XX) driver. The VCP driver creates a virtual COM port on your computer that you can use with any serial application. The D2XX driver allows you to access the chip directly through a DLL library. The driver comes in a combined driver model (CDM) package that installs both types of driver on your computer. However, you can only use one type of driver at a time with your device.
 
## How do I install the driver?
 
To install the driver for the Diamond Future Technology PC034 chip on your Windows 7 computer, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect your device to a spare USB port on your computer.
2. If there is an available Internet connection, Windows 7 will silently connect to the Windows Update website and install any suitable driver it finds for the device. If this happens, you do not need to continue with the next steps.
3. If no suitable driver is automatically found, go to the FTDI website[^4^] and download the CDM driver package for Windows 7.
4. Extract the downloaded file and run the setup executable file.
5. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
6. Restart your computer if prompted.

## How do I use the driver?
 
To use the driver for the Diamond Future Technology PC034 chip with your device, you need to choose whether you want to use the VCP or the D2XX mode. You can change this mode by editing the EEPROM of the chip using the FT\_PROG utility from FTDI[^4^]. By default, the chip will use the VCP mode unless you change it.
 
If you use the VCP mode, you can use any serial application that supports COM ports to communicate with your device. You can find out which COM port number has been assigned to your device by checking the Device Manager under Ports (COM & LPT). You can also change this number by right-clicking on the device and selecting Properties > Port Settings > Advanced > COM Port Number.
 
If you use the D2XX mode, you can use any application that supports the FTDI D2XX DLL library to communicate with your device. You can find examples of such applications on the FTDI website[^4^]. You can also use the FT\_Prog utility to test and configure your device.
 
## Conclusion
 
The Diamond Future Technology PC034 chip is a USB to serial converter that allows you to connect serial devices to your computer via a USB port. The driver for this chip is available on the FTDI website[^4^] and can be installed easily on your Windows 7 computer. You can choose between two types of driver: a VCP or a D2XX mode. The VCP mode creates a
